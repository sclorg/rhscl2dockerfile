RHSCL docker images charter
===========================

This document should serve as agreement what users may expect from docker images based on RHSCL packages.

**This is currently a proposal to be discussed primarily between RHSCL maintainers and OpenShift, one of the main customers of RHSCL docker images.**


Common requirements for all RHSCL docker images
-----------------------------------------------
The following information is valid for all RHSCL dockerfiles.

### Base images

What will be used in the docker images as the base image:
* `FROM rhel7` is used for RHEL-7 based images
* `FROM centos:centos7` is used for centos-7 based images
* `FROM rhel6` is used for RHEL-6 based images
* `FROM centos:centos6` is used for centos-6 based images


### Repositories enabled in the image

For installing necessary packages, the following repositories are enabled for RHEL-based images:
````
RUN yum install -y yum-utils && \
    yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms && \
    yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
````

These repos will be enabled for CentOS images:
```
RUN rpmkeys --import file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7
    (+ copr repository RPM packages for all necessary Software Collections that are installed)
```


### Labels and temporary environment variables:

OpenShift uses `IMAGE_TAGS`, `IMAGE_EXPOSE_SERVICES` and other `ENV` variables, which should serve for the same purpose as `LABEL`s in the future docker versions. According to the latest info the transition to the `LABEL` should happen as soon as `docker` 1.6 is available, which should be pretty soon and it shouldn't be necessary to include temporary solution with `ENV` variables to RHSCL docker images.

For `LABEL` we still need to define what the keys/values should be and what it means.


### Enabling the collection:

This part is more complicated than it seems from the first look. The bellow is example how this issue may be addressed without defining `ENTRYPOINT` for example of `mysql55` docker image.

When running the docker image with just 'bash' as command, Bash must be run with all necessary collections enabled (usually one, but for some images more).
```
docker run mysql55 bash
docker> echo $X_SCLS
mysql55
```

The above must be ensured also in cases we run `docker exec` for running container:
```
docker run --name myapp mysql55
docker exec -d myapp bash
bash> echo $X_SCLS
mysql55
```
(mind that entrypoint is not run in this case, so the collection has to be enabled somewhere else than in entrypoint)

We also need to execute all the commands in the `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD` already in proper environment, i.e. with collection(s) enabled.

The following Dockerfile snippet should make it work:
```
# Make sure proper ENV is set for every non-interactive invocation
ENV HOME /var/lib/mysql
ENV BASH_ENV /etc/profile.d/cont-env.sh
ADD ./cont-env.sh $HOME/.bashrc
ADD ./cont-env.sh /etc/profile.d/cont-env.sh
ADD ./functions.sh /usr/share/cont-layer/common/
ADD ./enablemariadb55.sh /usr/share/cont-layer/common/env.d/
```

...where content of cont-env.sh is:
```
source /usr/share/cont-layer/common/functions.sh
cont_source_scripts common env
unset -f cont_source_scripts
```

Content of functions.sh is:
```
# Sources *.sh in the following directories in this order:
# /usr/share/cont-layer/$1/$2.d
# /usr/share/cont-volume/$1/$2.d
cont_source_scripts() {
    [ -z "$2" ] && return
    for dir in cont-layer cont-volume ; do
        full_dir="/usr/share/$dir/${1}/${2}.d"
        for i in ${full_dir}/*.sh; do
            if [ -r "$i" ]; then
                . "$i"
            fi
        done
    done
}
```

Content of enablemariadb55.sh is:
```
#!/bin/bash
source scl_source enable mariadb55
```

The set of collections enabled should be extended in some upper layer, so we will have directory `/usr/share/cont-layer/common/env.d` that will include bash scripts to source.


Common requirements for all language stacks
-------------------------------------------

The following are requirements for language stacks containers (php, python, ruby, nodejs, perl).

### Devel packages installed:

In order to be able to build some modules from upstream repository, some devel packages are usually necessary. The following list may be the same for all language stack dockerfiles.

```bash
RUN yum install -y --setopt=tsflags=nodocs \
    autoconf \
    automake \
    bsdtar \
    curl-devel \
    epel-release \
    gcc-c++ \
    gdb \
    gettext \
    libxml2-devel \
    libxslt-devel \
    lsof \
    make \
    mysql-devel \
    mysql-libs \
    openssl-devel \
    postgresql-devel \
    procps-ng \
    scl-utils \
    sqlite-devel \
    tar \
    unzip \
    wget \
    which \
    yum-utils \
    zlib-devel && \
    yum clean all -y
```

### default user and its home directory

(This is just a proposal and this issue is being consulted at https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/env-and-stacks/2015-April/000771.html)

The application shouldn't run as root, so we need to create a user for containers that don't provide a specific user yet. (some packages like deamons do provide those users already, so those should be used)

```
ENV HOME /home/default
# Setup the 'default' user that is used for the build execution and for the
# application runtime execution.
# TODO: Use better UID and GID values
# discuss this at https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/env-and-stacks/2015-April/000771.html
RUN mkdir -p ${HOME} && \
    groupadd -r default -f -g 1000 && \
    useradd -u 1000 -r -g default -d ${HOME} -s /sbin/nologin \
            -c "Default Application User" default
```

### Exposing ports

If there is a port that is usually used for development or production, this port should be exposed in the Dockerfile. Common port that users usually use should be used in Dockerfile.

### php dockerfile:
* extra packages: TODO
* `EXPOSE` 8080


### python dockerfile:
* extra packages: `python-devel` `python-setuptools`
* `EXPOSE` 8080


### ruby dockerfile:
* collections: `ruby22`
* extra packages: `ruby-devel`  `rubygem-bundler`
* `EXPOSE` 8080


### rails dockerfile:
* collections: `ror41` `ruby22` `nodejs010`
* extra packages: just what ror41 installs by default
* `EXPOSE` 8080


### nodejs dockerfile:
* `EXPOSE` 8080


### perl dockerfile:
* `EXPOSE` 8080
* extra packages: `perl516-mod_perl` `perl516-perl-CPANPLUS`


Common requirements for daemons
-------------------------------
After running the container without any command, the daemon is run using exec (no other process is forking to run the daemon) -- this is necessary to pass signals properly.

Daemon is listening on 0.0.0.0 by default.

Data directory (if any) that is expected to be mounted shouldn't be home directory of user, there may be more stuff that we don't want to mount, so in some cases we use data/ subdirectory for data themselves (and VOLUME)

### Extending the docker images:

In order to allow just extending the docker image easily without rewriting scripts from scratch, the scripts should include hook scripts in places it makes sense from directory that may be mounted or extended in another layer, something similar to the following (for databases the hooks may be "preinit", "postinit"):

```
# this function sources *.sh in the following directories in this order:
# /usr/share/cont-layer/$1/$2.d
# /usr/share/cont-volume/$1/$2.d
source_scripts() {
    [ -z "$2" ] && return
    for dir in cont-layer cont-volume ; do
        full_dir="/usr/share/$dir/${1}/${2}.d"
        for i in ${full_dir}/*.sh; do
            if [ -r "$i" ]; then
                . "$i"
            fi
        done
    done
}
source_scripts mysql post-initdb
```

So the image that extends such an image will just place some Bash scripts into `/usr/share/cont-layer/mysql/post-initdb.d` directory and won't need to change anything else.


### Config files modification:

When possible, config files should be modified by creating another layer (container with the original used as BASE)

For ad-hoc changing the values it is then possible to change the config file by mounting a volume (directory or file). For example for mysql the configuration may be changed for every run this way:
```
docker run -v /mine/my.cnf:/etc/my.cnf mysql
```

For kubernetes environment, where mounting configuration is not easy currently, docker containers may accept environment variables, that will (if defined) cause adding appropriate option to the appropriate config file during start. Changing configuration this way won't be documented and will be used only in cases the configuration is not possible to be changed by passing own configuration file as mentioned above (OpenShift needs to pass environment variables only).

The environment variables for adjusting configuration will have common prefix for every configuration file, for example:

* `POSTGRESQL_CONFIG_` for `postgresql.conf`
* `MYSQL_CONFIG_` for `my.cnf`
* `MONGOD_CONFIG_` for `mongod.conf`
* `MONGOS_CONFIG_` for `mongos.conf`

Then user may define the following variables during container start:

```
POSTGRESQL_CONFIG_shared_buffers=true
MYSQL_CONFIG_ft_min_word_len=4
MONGOD_CONFIG_smallfiles=1
MONGOS_CONFIG_smallfiles=false
```

Defining those variables will cause:

* adding `shared_buffers=true` into `postgresql.conf`
* adding `ft_min_word_len=4` into `my.cnf`
* adding `smallfiles=true` into `mongod.conf`
* adding `smallfiles=false` into `mongos.conf`

This may be not the safest way to define the configuration, but it seems to be still better for maintaining than hardcoding the variables in some predefined template and changing the template for every version that changes default values or when another variable is necessary.

As for implementation the following is the minimal snippet that does the trick:
```
set | grep -e '^MYSQL_CONFIG_'|sed -e 's/^MYSQL_CONFIG_//' >>/etc/my.cnf.d/generated.cnf
```
